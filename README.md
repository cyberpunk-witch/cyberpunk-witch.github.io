README - cyberpunkwitch
======================
This is my personal website
I do not claim to be an amazing coder. I just like the name "cyberpunkwitch" and have used it places for several years now (I was the one who started the cyberpunk-witches group on facebook, although I've since left facebook because it is a (technically-impressive) trash fire anad the moderation is garbage)
index.html is the main page and entry point. You can simply open it in a browser.
I didn't bother to use much in the way of javascript as it's just a personal website and I'd like to keep it minimal
the demos however shall require js
they can be found on the appropriate page.
Thank you.
