##README - cyberpunkwitch
======================
This is my personal website
* I do not claim to be an amazing coder. 
* I like the name "cyberpunkwitch" and have used it places for several years now. It's basically my handle. 
* index.html is the main page and entry point. You can simply open it in a browser.
* I didn't bother to use much in the way of javascript as it's just a personal website and I'd like to keep it minimal
the demos however shall require js
* they can be found on the appropriate page.

Thank you.
