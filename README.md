##README - cyberpunkwitch
======================
This is my personal website
* I do not claim to be an amazing coder. 
* I like the name "cyberpunkwitch" and have used it places for several years now (I was the one who started the cyberpunk-witches group on facebook, although I've since left facebook because it is a (technically-impressive) trash fire anad the moderation is garbage). It's basically my handle but I don't take it too seriously. Maybe someday I'll earn the title.). 
* The title is open-source as far as I am concerned, and is not necessarily a statement of pagan religious belief (or not one). 
  * Mostly a 'cyberpunk witch' as I see it likes code or technology generally, has perhaps witchy spiritual feelings about it, and takes Clarke's Third Law perhaps a bit too literally, but in a lighthearted fashion. 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' 
  * We're like wannabe-technomancers who are still working on the 'sufficiently advanced' part, I suppose. Or you're a person (especially a woman but not limited to - anyone can be a witch) who works in tech and is just passionate about technology, aesthetics, and imagination, and likes the witch aesthetic. I'm not here to police your religious beliefs or otherwise, as long as they're not hateful or anti-science (as a method, distrust in specific institutions is sometimes well-warranted).
  * And a leftist, necessarily, as the right wing is against witches, against pagans generally, atheists and others, and also against women generally, as well as people of color, queer people generally, and on and on. We must publicly divest ourselves of the right wing and it's place in polite society - it has lost all moral mandate. Most important of all - not a terf, as transphobes are right-wing. Trans women are women, period. 
* index.html is the main page and entry point. You can simply open it in a browser.
* I didn't bother to use much in the way of javascript as it's just a personal website and I'd like to keep it minimal
the demos however shall require js
* they can be found on the appropriate page.

Thank you.
