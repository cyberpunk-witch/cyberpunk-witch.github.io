##README - cyberpunkwitch
======================
This is my personal website
* I do not claim to be an amazing coder. 
* I like the name "cyberpunkwitch" and have used it places for several years now (I was the one who started the cyberpunk-witches group on facebook, although I've since left facebook because it is a (technically-impressive) trash fire anad the moderation is garbage). It's basically my handle but I don't take it too seriously. Maybe someday I'll earn the title.). The title is open-source as far as I am concerned, and is not necessarily a statement of pagan religious belief (or not one). Mostly a 'cyberpunk witch' as I see it likes code or technology generally, has perhaps witchy spiritual feelings about it, and takes Clarke's Third Law perhaps a bit too literally, but in a lighthearted fashion. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' We're like technomancers who are still working on the 'sufficiently advanced' part, I suppose. Or you're a person (especially a woman but not limited to) who works in tech and is just passionate about technology, aesthetics, and imagination, and likes the witch aesthetic.
* index.html is the main page and entry point. You can simply open it in a browser.
* I didn't bother to use much in the way of javascript as it's just a personal website and I'd like to keep it minimal
the demos however shall require js
* they can be found on the appropriate page.

Thank you.
